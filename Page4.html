        <h1 style="text-align: center;font-size: 50px;"><b> Analysis </b></h1>

          The collection of poems I analyzed includes these poems: Having a Coke with You, Tug o' War, A poison tree, To all my friends. This includes many very important poets of the modern world, like: Frank O'Hara, Shel Silverstein, William Blake, May Yang. “Friendship is forever” is the theme I chose for this collection. Especially in hard times like now, we have to stick to our real friends, because it's important that we have someone that is there for us. Even without seeing them, we have to keep in touch and have social interactions, to keep us mentaly healthy.<br/>
          <br/>
          The first poem I analyzed was Having a Coke with You by Frank O'Hara. This poem expressed the love he felt for his real friends, even in the bad times. He also conveys to us that real friends want the best for each other at all costs.  This poem contains two large stanzas, with no rhyme scheme. Thepoem was written in the 60’s, which means it's pretty old. The author uses a very artistic diction, because he refers to a lot of artworks and portraits. His tone is happy and relaxed. This poem makes the reader feel the same way the author feels towards his friends.<br>
          <br/>
          Then I analized Tug o' War by Shel Silverstein, this poem was really simple, it has 1 stanza and  a rhyme scheme of AABBCBCDCD. The Author seems happy and full of love, because of what he says, like that friendship is more about enjoying and having fun, instead of fighting over small things. This makes the reader feel safe inside, thinking of the loving and peaceful world the author is talking about in the poem.<br/>
          <br/>
          The third poem I picked was A poison tree written by William Blake. This poem is pretty sad at the beginning, because the author expresses all his sadness and regret towards what happened with his friend.  He even calls his friend his foe. But towards the last stanza the friend comes to the house, and apologises. This poem has 4 stanzas, each stanza has a rhyme scheme of AABB. His tone is regretful and hopeless, until the third stanza where there is a change in the tone. From here on the Author feels better and his tone sounds happy and excited to see his friend.<br>
          <br/>
          The next poem I analyzed is To all my friends by May Yang, this poem has 9 stanzas and a rhyme scheme of ABAB per stanza. This poem is about the Author expressing how thankful she is for being where she is and having those friends. The tone is happy and graceful because of the happy and repeating diction she uses.<br/>
          <br/>
          The poem I wrote is called Forever Friendship. This poem has one long stanza and doesn't have a rhyme scheme. The tone I tried to create is a soft and happy tone. This poem is about how a real friendship is forever, because of the connections that are created through the way.<br/>
          <br/>
          I chose this theme, because in difficult situations like the one we are in, it is extremely important to keep in touch with friends and have social interactions. Even in this times it`s a good idea to have a virtual meeting to relax a bit of the stress everyone is going through. I think these poems can be a good motivation for other people to have social interactions to keep their mental and emotional Health good.<br/>

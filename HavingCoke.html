              is even more fun than going to San Sebastian, Irún, Hendaye, Biarritz, Bayonne <br/>
              or being sick to my stomach on the Travesera de Gracia in Barcelona <br/>
              partly because in your orange shirt you look like a better happier St. Sebastian <br/>
              partly because of my love for you, partly because of your love for yoghurt <br/>
              partly because of the fluorescent orange tulips around the birches <br/>
              partly because of the secrecy our smiles take on before people and statuary <br/> 
              it is hard to believe when I’m with you that there can be anything as still<br/>
              as solemn as unpleasantly definitive as statuary when right in front of it<br/>
              in the warm New York 4 o’clock light we are drifting back and forth<br/>
              between each other like a tree breathing through its spectacles<br/>
              <br/>
              and the portrait show seems to have no faces in it at all, just paint<br/>
              you suddenly wonder why in the world anyone ever did them I look<br/>
              at you and I would rather look at you than all the portraits in the world<br/>
              except possibly for the Polish Rider occasionally and anyway it’s in the Frick<br/>
              which thank heavens you haven’t gone to yet so we can go together for the first time<br/>
              and the fact that you move so beautifully more or less takes care of Futurism<br/>
              just as at home I never think of the Nude Descending a Staircase or<br/>
              at a rehearsal a single drawing of Leonardo or Michelangelo that used to wow me<br/>
              and what good does all the research of the Impressionists do them<br/>
              when they never got the right person to stand near the tree when the sun sank<br/>
              or for that matter Marino Marini when he didn’t pick the rider as carefully<br/>
              as the horse it seems they were all cheated of some marvelous experience<br/>
              which is not going to go wasted on me which is why I’m telling you about it<br/>
